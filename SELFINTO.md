## Yuanyuan Lu - Software Developer
### Background
My coding journey commenced in April 2021 when I made the pivotal decision to transition my career towards a technical role. Through self-directed learning, I took the next step by enrolling in a Higher Diploma program in Software Development. Starting with Java, I later delved into full-stack web development and mobile development. In August 2023, I successfully graduated from University College Dublin, Ireland, attaining a Master's degree in Computer Science. 

Before that, I was a UI designer and had accumulated abundant experience in a variety of projects, during which I honed my collaborative abilities.

### Career goal & expectations for this full-stack programme
My career aspiration is to grow into a software architect. I have been focusing on back-end development and now exploring more into fullstack development. Therefore, I am seeking opportunities of junior backend/fullstack developer. 

While I believe Integrify would provide skills that are in need in Finnish job market, I hope the projects would be involved in real-world projects instead of simplified and/or simulated ones.
